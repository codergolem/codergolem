      <p><em>About me</em></p>

<p>I am a software developer and consultant focused on cloud infrastructure. I have 10 years of experience working to deliver software that matters to business and people.</p>

<p>I have advanced hands-on and architecture experience running applications (monolith and microservices) in the cloud , using the following technologies:</p>

<ul>

<li>Python, Bash, Linux administration skills.</li>

<li>TestCafe, Selenium.</li>
</ul>

<p>I am generalist that has also hands-on experience programming with: JavaScript,  Java ,Golang and Clojure and using Google Cloud and Kubernetes.</p>

<p>I believe that a culture of collaboration, continuous experimentation and fast learning matters as much as the engineering skills. I have successfully led on-prem to cloud migration projects, moving hundreds of applications to AWS, and helping multiple teams to understand and embrace the DevOps principles.</p>

<p><em>What can I offer ?</em></p>

<li><p>Infrastructure Development and Operations.</p></li>

<li><p>Training and Coach : Test Driven Development, All things around software testing and quality, Agile and DevOps practices, Bussiness/Requierment Analysis, Cloud Architecture, Kanban and Lean, Pair Programming, Developer Productivity, Automation.</p></li>

<li><p>Test Automation (from UI to Infrastructure).</p></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Things I have done:</em></p>

<p>I worked for the last fiver years with the technology consultancy  ThoughtWorks in Germany, coaching from startups (20+ people) to the supremely large organisations (10K+ people) in how to deliver software that has a relevant business impact.</p>

<p>Some projects and clients I have worked for include:</p>

<ul>
<li>One of the biggest automotive companies in Germany: I led a cloud migration project to deploy hundreds of applications in AWS and coaching multiple teams to develop and operate them.</li>
</ul>
